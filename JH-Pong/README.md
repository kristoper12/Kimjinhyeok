# pong-from-scratch

# This game uses a reinforcement learning technique called Deep Q-Learning.

# Take the ball coordinates and the stick coordinates to learn 

# and decide where to move the stick based on the learned data.

# I used tkinter to build the game myself, 

# and I used the tensorflow keras library for learning.
